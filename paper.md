# Summary



# Statement of need

1) Allows a researcher to convert elemental quants to meaningful conclusions about mineral phases through python scripts.

2) Reproducibility because using the same scripts.

3) Produces standard outputs for various minerals including ternary diagrams, etc. improving reproducibility between researchers.

4) Eases understanding mineral systems that are new to the researcher and how that leads into Qmin.

5) Allows removing common artifacts from elemental quantifications.
