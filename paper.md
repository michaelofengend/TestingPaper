# Summary



# Statement of need

1) Allows a researcher to convert elemental quants to meaningful conclusions about mineral phases through python scripts.

2) Reproducibility because using the same scripts.

3) Produces standard outputs for various minerals including ternary diagrams, etc. improving reproducibility between researchers.

4) Eases understanding mineral systems that are new to the researcher â€” lead into Qmin.

5) Allows removing common artifacts from elemental quantifications.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
